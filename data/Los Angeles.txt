A GREEN NEW DEAL. Mayor Garcetti launched Los Angeles’ Green New Deal — a comprehensive roadmap to protect our environment, strengthen our economy, and build a more equitable future. The Green New Deal, which serves as an ambitious update to Los Angeles’ first-ever Sustainable City pLAn, sets aggressive goals for the city’s sustainable future, tackles the climate emergency with accelerated targets, strengthens our economy and our middle class, and sets L.A. on course to be carbon neutral by 2050 — solidifying L.A.’s position as the national leader in solar energy, electric vehicle infrastructure, and green jobs and a global leader in upholding the Paris Climate Agreement. Taken together, by 2050, the work and milestones of our Green New Deal are expected to save more than 1,600 lives, 660 trips to the hospital, and $16 billion in avoided healthcare expenses each year.
AGGRESSIVE TARGETS, STRONG ACTION. Every year since the release of the first Sustainable City pLAn in 2015, L.A. has reported on the progress made in achieving our sustainability goals. The Annual Reports ensure rigorous and transparent evaluation of our work and encourage bold action to fulfill our targets. Some of the defining accomplishments include:
* Los Angeles is on track to meet the Paris Climate Agreement and reduce our fair share of global emissions by 2030. L.A.’s greenhouse gas emissions are now 24% below 1990 levels.
* In February 2020, Mayor Garcetti signed Executive Directive 25 “L.A.’s Green New Deal: Leading By Example” to accelerate the work of L.A.’s Green New Deal and ensure City government is leading the way in protecting our environment and growing a green, inclusive economy. 
* In April 2021, the groundbreaking LA100 study was released providing a blueprint for achieving Mayor Garcetti’s commitment for a 100% carbon free grid in Los Angeles by 2035.
* L.A. has been ranked the #1 Solar City in America 6 out of the past 7 years with over 500 MW of local solar power installed - enough to power over 140,000 homes.

CLIMATE MAYORS. Mayor Garcetti co-founded Climate Mayors, a bipartisan network of over 470 U.S. mayors representing 74 million Americans from 48 states working together to demonstrate meaningful action and express and build political will for effective federal and global policy action on climate change.
To help cities across the country electrify their fleets, Mayor Garcetti launched the Climate Mayors Electric Vehicle (EV) Purchasing Collaborative.
SAVING THE DROP. In the face of a historic drought, the Mayor’s Office of Sustainability analyzed water consumption data by ZIP code to focus the Save the Dropconservation campaign on areas with excessive usage. The people of Los Angeles responded, and the city achieved a 20% reduction in water consumption in January of 2017. In response to the Mayor’s 5th Executive Directive to create a more water wise city, the City passed the most stringent water efficiency ordinance in any big city in the U.S. —  requiring a 20% reduction in indoor water use for new buildings and all redevelopments — which went into effect in June 2016. Since Mayor Garcetti took office, L.A. has saved a total of 221.6 billion gallons of water - enough to fill 336,000 Olympic size swimming pools.
A MORE SELF-RELIANT FUTURE. At the beginning of Mayor Garcetti’s Administration, only 15% of our water was sourced locally, making us highly dependent on imported water from inside and outside of California. With L.A.’s Green New Deal goal of sourcing 70% of our water locally, we have increased local water supply to 65% through investments in stormwater capture and wastewater recycling. Our boldest initiative, Operation NEXT, focuses on achieving our goal of recycling 100% of our wastewater by 2035. Today recycled water only accounts for 2% of our water, but Operation NEXT will increase that to 35% by 2035 — and the finished project will produce three times more water than the L.A. Aqueduct. These efforts are ensuring a resilient and dependable clean water supply for generations to come.
RENEWABLE POWER. In 2017, Mayor Garcetti initiated the landmark LA100 study - the most comprehensive study ever of an electric grid as complex as L.A.’s. Done in partnership with the Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Lab, the study assessed the feasibility of running L.A.’s grid on 100% renewable energy within the next 20 years. Utilizing the most cutting-edge analytics and supercomputing, 100 million model runs, and incorporating significant feedback from a formal advisory group of local stakeholders, the answer was a resounding yes - 100% renewable energy in L.A. is achievable, affordable, and reliable.
Based on the LA100 study, Mayor Garcetti announced that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power will pursue an 80% renewable and 97% carbon free grid by 2030, and 100% carbon free energy by 2035, 10 years ahead of schedule. The work has already begun with LADWP increasing renewable energy locally and across the Western U.S. We are expanding building electrification, energy efficiency programs, and electric vehicle charger incentives to cut pollution and save people money, while pursuing clean energy innovation to quickly phase out L.A.’s existing natural gas plants. The benefits of this work will be felt for generations to come with reduced greenhouse gas emissions, cleaner air, improved resilience, and significant public health benefits, including an estimated $1 billion in avoided healthcare costs by mid-century.
GREENER, CLEANER ECONOMY. Mayor Garcetti led L.A. to achieve his goal of 20,000 new green jobs ahead of schedule — and in his second term, continues the mission through new investments in public transportation,  renewable energy, stormwater management, energy efficiency, affordable housing, and recycling. To support this growing economy,  L.A. has attracted $618 million in green investments, supported 281 startups, and created 2,324 jobs as of May, 2021 through the LA Cleantech Incubator.
HERE COMES THE SUN. Under Mayor Garcetti’s leadership, L.A. remains the #1 solar city in America. L.A. now has 527 MW worth of installed local solar capacity and counting  — enough to power 145,500 homes. Since January 2021, L.A. has installed 5.6 MW of Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) solar projects, for a grand total of 86.2 MW. Of the latest FiT installations, over half were located in disadvantaged communities. L.A. continues to innovate, with co-located solar and storage projects coming soon to Angelenos.
ELECTRIC AVENUE. The Mayor is working to electrify LADOT and Metro’s fleets, increase the procurement of electric trucks and buses, and move to zero emissions goods. To advance this work, Mayor Garcetti and Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia signed a joint declaration setting ambitious goals for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to make the transition to zero emissions in their Clean Air Action Plan (CAAP). In May 2021, electrification of Metro’s G line — one of the most heavily utilized — was completed moving the City closer to its target of 100% zero emission buses at LADOT by 2028 and L.A. Metro by 2030.
CHARGE! In L.A.’s Green New Deal, the City committed to installing 10,000 commercial and publicly available EV charging stations by the end of 2022 to help make clean transportation less expensive and more convenient. The City surpassed this goal over a year early — and today over 12,000 chargers have been installed, with more to come.
EV RIDERS. L.A. became the first city to roll out an electric car share program designed to serve low-income residents. This program helps the city reduce greenhouse gas emissions while providing disadvantaged communities with more convenient and affordable clean transportation options. Since its launch, over 63,000 trips were taken of which 53% have been for essential trips. Altogether, the program has reduced over 2,200 metric tons of carbon dioxide. An expansion that will more than double the number of cars and chargers is in the works.
TRANSFORMING COMMUNITIES. L.A. has secured over $55 million in state cap-and-trade funding and over $200 million in leveraged funds to support investments in Watts, Pacoima, and South L.A. for community-based, sustainability projects. By developing and implementing projects that include urban greening, renewable energy, affordable housing, and anti-displacements plans — to name a few — each community is building upon decades of grassroots organizing and engagement to support the priorities of their residents and deliver meaningful change that revitalizes neighborhoods.
SMART, SUSTAINABLE BUILDINGS.  L.A. continues to top the national charts as the #1 ENERGY STAR city as rated by the U.S. Dept of Energy, boasting 587 high-performing buildings citywide in 2020. These buildings saved $203 million in energy costs through efficiency savings during L.A.’s 9th year at the top of the list. LADWP leads the way in delivering energy cost savings to buildings of all shapes and sizes. Since Mayor Garcetti took office, 11,120 GWh have been saved in L.A.’s buildings through electric utility rebates and incentives for energy efficiency, saving Angelenos $1.78 billion on their utility bills. 
Los Angeles created one of the first and most comprehensive water efficiency and energy benchmarking laws of large U.S. cities, and Mayor Garcetti leads by example on sustainable building materials. Under Executive Directive 25, Los Angeles became the first city to adopt the Buy Clean CA Act, which sets carbon disclosure and performance requirements for building materials used in city projects.
HOME SWEET HOME. Mayor Garcetti has already surpassed his goal to build 15,000 affordable housing units by 2021, but we’re not stopping: by 2035, the city will see 45,000 new units for Angelenos. Through Proposition HHH, land use incentives, and other financial programs, L.A. is delivering affordability for households in need. During the COVID-19 crisis, L.A. delivered over $100 million in rental assistance and secured additional protections for renters like eviction moratoriums and rent increase freezes. The Mayor’s signature “A Bridge Home” program has opened 28 locations for transitional housing serving Angelenos experiencing homelessness, with more in development.
ADDRESSING EQUITY THROUGH INNOVATIVE GOVERNANCE. Mayor Garcetti and Councilmember Paul Koretz launched the first-ever Climate Emergency Mobilization Office (CEMO) that embeds a participatory governance model in the City by fostering collaboration with policymakers and community leaders to create opportunities to improve sustainability and resilience at L.A.’s most burdened communities. The CEMO works hand-in-hand with a newly formed Climate Emergency Commission, consisting of frontline communities, indigenous representatives, climate and air quality experts, labor voices, and business leaders, all advising on climate and clean air policy that L.A. implements. Community assemblies will provide a forum for residents to engage with decision makers and  provide real time guidance and feedback within impacted communities.
DATA IS POWER. L.A. is now measuring air quality at a hyperlocal level. Over 20 air sensors have been deployed in underserved communities in L.A. that lack air quality data. Watts, Boyle Heights, Wilmington, and South L.A. are all recipients of air monitors that are installed on City street lights and inside library branches located near schools, parks, and areas where families live and breathe. Better tracking of air quality at a neighborhood scale helps increase local awareness of air quality challenges and creates opportunities for developing more targeted solutions that improve health. For the Watts air quality monitoring program, visit the Watts Rising Data Portal.
SO COOL. L.A. has been tackling heat through a multifaceted approach. It was the first U.S. city to test on-road use of cool pavement to combat urban heat and is piloting six cool neighborhoods in vulnerable communities incorporating cooling elements such as cool pavement, shade trees, and bus shelters. Additionally, through the new cool roof requirements, tens of thousands of cool roofs have been installed. Mayor Garcetti hired L.A.’s first City Forest Officer and has supported the planting of over 50,000 trees in just two years.
NATURALLY L.A. As a globally recognized biodiversity hotspot, L.A. has redoubled its efforts to protect its ecosystem with the release of L.A.’s Biodiversity Report and L.A.’s Biodiversity Index. L.A. is the first city in North America to apply the Singapore Index on Cities’ biodiversity. L.A. is also piloting a wildlife corridor and has been certified a biodiversity haven by the National Wildlife Federation.
YOUTH VOICES. Mayor Garcetti launched L.A.’s first Mayor’s Youth Council for Climate Action in 2019 to help drive ambitious climate action, raise awareness, and engage Angelenos on the solutions. Since then, the Mayor’s Youth Council for Climate Action has met with local and global leaders to underscore the urgency of the climate crisis and has served as a model for similar climate-oriented youth councils across the country and globally.
